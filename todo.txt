Everything below this line was created by Tim Nelson and Matt Geyer in the summer of 
2011. Lack of initiative slowed progress to a dead halt. From here on out, everything 
above this line has been entered on or after September 20, 2011.

	Began looking at competition:
		Garagesalefinder.com sucks giant penis, but does have a few listings.
		Garagesaletracker.com is legit, already has an iphone app
		Garagesalerover, seems to have sales, but you have to pay for nice features
	Looking at garagesaletracker on iphone, reading negative feedback so we improve upon their idea.
	Garagesaletracker only has 2/5 starts, lots of bad reviews
	So far the competition blows, we can do better.
Things to do:
	Make new github account that we can all log into.
	Purchase a domain name 
	Figure out what we should do, set up LLC possibly?
Things accomplished:
	Decided on github as version control
	bought jack in the box
	Pre-assesment is that matt and tim would claim 40-45% of profit (if it makes any money) and j would get 10-20% initially
	Github SSH public keys for Matt and Tim
		
		
		
		 
Ideas:	
	Thumbsup/thumbsdown for EACH garagesale, vetting system based off of users. Or even just feedback comment
